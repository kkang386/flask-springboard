Intend:

    This code base serve a basic setup for starting up new Flask project for API and simple web pages. It demonstrates the ways of how to do the followings:

        * Isolate configuration into a single file: config.py, so it maybe updated, patched for different environments without touch the rest of the code.

        * Isolate db models into a single file: project/models.py, so that db init, pytest and app may run independently without code changes.

        * Isolate routing setup from app code into a single file: project/routes.py, so that route definitions are clean and easy to maintain.

        * Easy runtime environemnt selection with short env names than the long class names. ENV_NAME still needs to be set in the envs.

        * Reusable db setup script: setup.py, it maybe run againest any environments in config.py.  

        * Sample unitests with pytest including tests on db setup and tear down, sample data setup from files, web pages access, api access, etc.

        * Showing usage of following key modules and features: flask_sqlalchemy, flask_restful api Resource, flask_caching, reqparse, 

          marshal_with, pytest, fixtures, sqlite, PyMySQL


Design, to be brief:

    Core:

        config.py

        project/envs.py

        project/models.py

        project/controllers.py

        project/routes.py 

        project/__init__.py

    Consumers:
    
        setup.py
    
        main.py

        tests/test_*


Usage:

    Install:

        git clone https://github.com/kennyj2016/flask-startup.git 

        cd flask-startup

        virtualenv .

        source ./bin/activate

        pip install -r requirements.txt

    Every day ...:

        cd flask-startup

        source ./bin/activate

        export ENV_NAME=test

        pytest tests

        export ENV_NAME=dev

        python setup.py

        python main.py    
    
        ...

Requirements:
    
        Python 3.8 or close
